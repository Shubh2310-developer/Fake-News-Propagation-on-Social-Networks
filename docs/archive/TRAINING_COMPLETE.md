### Training Script

**Primary Script**: `/home/ghost/fake-news-game-theory/scripts/train_simple_fast.py`

This script:
- Loads and combines multiple datasets
- Performs efficient text preprocessing
- Extracts TF-IDF and numerical features
- Trains 4 ML models optimized for fake news detection
- Achieves 99%+ accuracy on tree-based models

### How to Retrain

```bash
cd /home/ghost/fake-news-game-theory
/home/ghost/anaconda3/bin/conda run -n fake_news python scripts/train_simple_fast.py
```

### Testing Models

Use the test script to verify performance:

```bash
/home/ghost/anaconda3/bin/conda run -n fake_news python scripts/test_all_models.py
```

### Ensemble Model

The ensemble combines all 4 models using weighted voting:
- **Gradient Boosting**: Weight 2.0 (highest)
- **Random Forest**: Weight 1.5
- **Naive Bayes**: Weight 1.0
- **Logistic Regression**: Weight 0.5 (lowest)

**Result**: 99.86% accuracy on 10,000 test samples

### Next Steps

1. ✅ **Ensemble Model**: Created and tested - 99.86% accuracy
2. **LSTM/BERT Models** (Optional): If you need deep learning models for comparison
3. **Integration**: All models are ready for backend API integration
4. **Production Deployment**: Use `ensemble_config.joblib` for best results

### Comparison with Previous Scripts

| Script | Issue | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `train_optimized.py` | Memory issues with 80K samples | ✗ Fixed |
| `complete_training_pipeline.py` | Preprocessing errors | ✗ Fixed |
| `retrain_models.py` | Limited to LIAR dataset only | ✗ Improved |
| **`train_simple_fast.py`** | ✓ Fast, efficient, 99%+ accuracy | ✓ **Current** |

### Key Improvements
