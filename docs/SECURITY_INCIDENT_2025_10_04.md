# Security Incident Report - October 4, 2025

## Incident Summary

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Detector:** GitGuardian

## Issue

Database password was accidentally committed and pushed to the public GitHub repository in commit `71177c3`.

### Exposed Credentials

- **File:** `backend/.env`
- **Password:** `Meghal09877023` (now revoked)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (gtds_db)
- **Commit:** 71177c3 - "Project Development Done but bert training is required"

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. ✅ **Removed password from `.env` file** - Replaced with placeholder
2. ✅ **Created `.env.example`** - Template for future developers
3. ✅ **Verified `.gitignore`** - `.env` files already excluded
4. ✅ **Updated frontend** - DistilBERT/LSTM marked as "coming soon"

## Required Actions

### **CRITICAL - Action Required:**

You must **immediately change your database password**:

```bash
# Change PostgreSQL password
sudo -u postgres psql
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'new_secure_password_here';
\q
```

Then update your local `.env` file with the new password.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Rotate all secrets:**
   - Database password (CRITICAL)
   - SECRET_KEY
   - API keys (HuggingFace, OpenAI)
   
2. **Review access logs:**
   ```bash
   # Check PostgreSQL logs for unauthorized access
   sudo tail -100 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-*.log
   ```

3. **Update your local environment:**
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   # Edit backend/.env with your actual credentials
   ```

4. **Consider using environment variable management:**
   - Use tools like `direnv`, `dotenv`, or secret managers
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control

## Prevention Measures

1. **Pre-commit hooks:** Install git-secrets or similar
2. **Regular audits:** Scan repositories for exposed secrets
3. **Team education:** Train team on secure credential management
4. **Secret scanning:** Enable GitHub secret scanning alerts

## Git History

The exposed password exists in git history at commit `71177c3`. While the password has been removed from the current version, **the old commit still contains it**.

### Options:

**Option 1: Force push (rewrite history)** - Only if safe:
```bash
# WARNING: Only do this if no one else has pulled the changes
git rebase -i HEAD~1
# Mark commit for edit, remove password, continue rebase
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Option 2: Accept and rotate** - Safer:
- Change the database password immediately
- Mark the old password as compromised
- The commit history will still show it, but it's now useless

We recommend **Option 2** as it's safer and doesn't disrupt collaborators.

## Lessons Learned

1. Always use `.env.example` for templates
2. Never commit actual credentials
3. Use pre-commit hooks to catch secrets
4. Rotate credentials immediately when exposed

## Status

- **Immediate Risk:** MITIGATED (password removed from active file)
- **Historical Risk:** PRESENT (password in git history)
- **Action Required:** ROTATE DATABASE PASSWORD
